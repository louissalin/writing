the journey of a software developer

keeping my family afloat, living within our means, paying debt, saving money

why I'm not buying a house

I'm constantly wary about the future. No water in the lake, the unmaintainable growth required to sustain debt and the economy. No wonder I'm bad at sniffing out opportunities. Is there a redeeming quality?

Motivation comes from competition, but not in a competitive sense. I feel compelled to do something when others are doing it and I feel like I have to do better, but not to beat them, just because I know I can, and should.

Kids know how to set my priorities straight: by giving me a heart felt hug.
