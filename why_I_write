A means of expression

    Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. 
        - Thomas Edisson

I've have the urge to start writing too many times now to ignore it any longer. It's a reccuring feeling that relentlessly surfaces every few months and I think that I should really take notice this time. This is not my first attempt. It's not my second one either. I have started writing multiple times in the past, but for the wrong reasons and my efforts where always short lived. This time, I want to be serious about it. I want it to be hard work. I want to hate the thought of having to sit down and write. And this time, I'm going to love it.

It is important that I start by defining the reasons that drive me to write. When I usually sit down to put words down on paper, it is because I've been hit by inspiration, a bi-annual event that leaves me hopeful, but also very sad. Inspiration is a flicker, a tiny spark in my mind with immense emotional power. It'll drive me to sit down at the computer, write a few words, signup on a blogging platform, publish an article or two or three and... and then nothing. I let it fade away, waiting for the next burst of inspiration to hit me. Inspiration is what is currently fueling the writing of these exact words. But by the time I'm done with this paragraph, inspiration will be gone. All I'll have is this emotional piece of malformed text. Not good enough to publish, without meat and flesh, just a collection of words that represent the initial idea, the seed of what could become something good.

Writing is painful, something I've said before on another blog or maybe even in a printed newspaper. I can't remember. What I can recall, however, is how easy it is when I get started. When my muse comes to visit, she gives me enough ideas to sustain me for a few weeks. But my muse must have other clients because she never sticks around very long and my writing starts slowing down. Texts need to be revised and refined, ideas need to be fleshed out and arguments need to be structured. This is the reason I have a love/hate relationship with the quote I wrote at the top of this page. I agree with it entirely yet I can't bring myself to perspire for more than a month, after which my motivation fizzles out and I run out of unicorn juice.

I'm not the only one who finds the art of writing difficult. About a year ago I sat down and read "The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles" by Steven Pressfield. This book warns the reader against resistance and how it does its best to slow down any creative effort, unleashing a last resort all-or-nothing battle against us when projects near their completion to try and make us fail. As someone who has a hard time finishing, or just even reaching a stage where the finish line is in sight, this was relevatory. I must be careful, however, to not use resistance as the reason I did not finish a project. I should instead, and righlty, blame myself. I could always draw my inspiration on George R.R. Martin, author of the Game of Thrones series, who claims to not like the act of writing, but instead enjoys having written.

Creativity is hard work. I've heard or read this over and over again. Michael Ruhlman, a successful food author (he's written the cookbooks for most of the best chefs in this country, appeared multiple times as a judge on Iron Chef America and ended up good buddies with Anthony Bourdain,) makes a point of writing everyday. Jerry Seinfeld does the exact same thing but keeps track of his efforts by drawing a line accross his calendar for every day that he writes. By working everyday, that line becomes continuous and the longer it becomes, the less you're inclined to skip a day and break it. 

I need a process. I need to write everyday. This needs to be work. I want this. I want to write. Everyday, instead of playing Minecraft, I could be crafting a text. It's not as fun, but then, collecting stacks of sand and coal to make glass isn't terribly fun either. The end result of my Minecraft creation, what I do with the glass I painstakingly created, is superficial. The emotion of satisfaction that I feel is only temporary. What I created isn't real. It doesn't really exist. I spent hours arranging pixels on a screen. That's not very satisfying and I end up feeling empty.

Why do I want to write? I feel like I need to express myself. I used to think I wanted an audience I could influence. I don't really care about this anymore.

English isn't my first language and my vocabulary isn't where I'd like it to be. How can I get better?
